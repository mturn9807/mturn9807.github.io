	<h3>19 July 2018</h3>
	<p>Today, we did an activity where we had to decrypt a message from Ariana Venti (LOL). She had gone missing between sets at Coachella, and no one knew where she had gone. Her PA said that she had gotten a text about a family emergency, but when we investigated the scene we found the coded message as well as some slime that had letter beads in it. The beads spelled out "THE KEY IS IN YOUR HANDS," so we figured out that the key was SLIME.</p>
	<p>We had already determined that this could not be a Caesar cipher or any one-to-one cipher because there were three different one letter words in the code and also, there weren't the patterns you expect from those. That meant that it was probaby a Vigenere cipher. After we performed the Vigenere decryption, we determined that the message said: "I have a message for you, but I must tell you in secret. Can you please get on my laptop and do the YKW?"</p>
